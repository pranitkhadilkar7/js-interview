// Document Object Model (DOM) is created by browser when it parses HTML or XML
// Below is the process to create DOM

// 1. Parsing: When browser receives the HTML or XML from the server, it starts the 
// parsing of the of the document. Parsing involves breaking down the document into
// the structured representation that the browser can understand and manupulate

// 2. Tokenization: Browsers parses the HTML or XML into the tokesn which represents
// different part of the document such as element, attribute, and text content

// 3. Building the DOM tree: Using these tokens browser constructs tree like structure
// known as DOM tree. This tree represents the hierarchical structure of the document
// which each element, attribute and text node represented as a node in the tree
